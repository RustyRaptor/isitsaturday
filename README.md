# IsItSaturday

This is a web app which checks if it is Saturday anywhere in the world in order to let the user know if it is time to ****post on />p/ or not. 

/>p/ is a facebook group for discussing programming and anything STEM related called Implying We Can Programming. You can find it here. https://www.facebook.com/groups/implyingprogramming/

This web app uses a NodeJS Express web server and Handlebars for template rendering. This way there is no front-end Jabascript involved. It uses a very simple algorithm to check if it's saturday for certain timezone offsets.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have git installed. Follow your operating system's instructions to install it. 
1. In Ubuntu it is simply:
```
sudo apt install git
```
2. Clone this repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/RustyRaptor/isitsaturday.git
``` 




### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS and NPM installed. I recommend installing it using NVM you can find NVM and install instructions at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

NodeJS website: 
https://nodejs.org

### Installing

1. In the root folder of the project run:

```
npm install
``` 


2. Now in the same folder run:
```
node server.js
```

3. By default the web server will listen on port 3000 or it will use the $PORT environment variable if it is set. With that being said if you want to change the port it runs on simply run this command in bash:

```
export PORT=<port_number>
```
replace <port_number> with the port number you want it to listen on for example:

```
export PORT=3002
```
if you want it to listen on port 3002. 

When you start the server it will print out a message that includes the port it is running on. If the number matches the port you set then you've set it successfully. 

It will look something like: 
```
Server is up on port 3000
```

Now to see it in action open a web browser and point it to localhost:<port_number>
replacing <port_number> with the port you set or with 3000 if you used the default port like so:
localhost:3000
